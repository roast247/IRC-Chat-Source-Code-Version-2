# IRC-Chat-Source-Code-Version-2
This is Version 2 of the IRC chat, this version contains both the client and server combined

PLEASE HELP! I'm not sure how to add an encryption key that the server host can input that the client has to input in order to join the chat PLEASE HELP! If you could tell me how to do this in the issues tab that would be great!
